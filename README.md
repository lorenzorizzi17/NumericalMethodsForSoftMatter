# NumericalMethodsForSoftMatter

This repository contains the homework assignments and code developed for the Numerical Methods for Soft Matter course at the University of Padova, taught by Prof. Orlandini and Prof. Locatelli during the 2025/2026 academic year. In particular, it includes:
- Homework 1: Sampling random numbers from a given arbitrary 1D distribution (using the inverse CDF or rejection method) or from a multi-dimensional distribution.
- Homework 2: Direct Monte Carlo method to numerically estimate integrals in one or more dimensions, including the use of importance sampling to reduce variance
- Homework 3: Theory of Markov chains (aperiodicity, irreducibility, ergodicity, invariant distribution, etc.).
- Homework 4: 2D Ising model at zero field using the Metropolis algorithm with local dynamics. Study of phase transitions and order parameters (magnetization, energy, specific heat, and susceptibility). Diagnostics of the Markov chain near criticality, including estimates of the correlation length, critical slowing down, and integrated correlation time. The full code for the 2D Ising simulation is written in C++ for efficiency and is hosted in a separate dedicated repository, which extends beyond this specific homework with different MCMC engines: [YAIS repo](https://github.com/lorenzorizzi17/YAIS). Have a look at it!
- Homework 5: Simulation of the [Active Ising model](https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.05749) in 2D with periodic boundary conditions, illustrating a non-equilibrium steady-state (NESS) system and out-of-equilibrium phase transitions. Characterization of the three phases in the $(\rho, T)$ plane (gas, liquid, coexistence) and phase portrait. The code for the Active Ising model is hosted in a [dedicated repository](https://github.com/lorenzorizzi17/ActiveIsingModel).
