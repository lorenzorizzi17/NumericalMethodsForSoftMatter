The zipped file contains two initial conditions, one with N=32 particles and one with N=108 particles. 

In both cases, the particles have been arranged in a perfect FCC crystal. 
Each file contains N+2 rows; the first one is the number of particle, the second one is a string that you can ignore. 

The data follows: you find 4 columns, you can discard the first one, the other three are the x,y,z coordinates (in this order)


The box size in the N=32 case is L=3.08123σ ; in the case N=108, L=4.621845σ
